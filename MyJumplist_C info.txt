(1) At minimum, a valid MYJUMPLIST_ITEM must set szTitle and szPath, except
when its isSeparator is set to TRUE.

(2) MYJUMPLIST_GROUP can represent 4 types of group.

The first two types are Recent and Frequent.
To make them show up, make sure
* your application is registered to handle a certain file type
* you call SHAddToRecentDocs() when opening file / use IFileDialog
* user doesn't disable the "show recent items on Jumplist" setting
As for the differences between them, you may find it on MSDN.

The third type is Unnamed Tasks.
This type has the least limitation. It won't be affected by privacy settings.
As long as the MYJUMPLIST_ITEM is valid, it should works as expected.
PS: If there are too many tasks, some might not show up.
This is by design, by Microsoft.

The last one is Named Tasks.
It works like Unnamed Tasks, but may be pinned/removed.
If "show recent items on Jumplist" setting is disabled, it wouldn't be shown.
When adding MYJUMPLIST_ITEM to this, please set szPath as well.
Otherwise it may not be pinned/removed (seems like fixed in Win10).

(3) When using MyJumplist_SetGroups(),
* Any type of MYJUMPLIST_GROUP may be added only once.
* If want to add Unnamed Tasks, it must be the last one.
* Only the last group may contain separator(s).
